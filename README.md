Title: Number Guessing Game
Description:
This is a simple Python program that implements a classic number guessing game. The user is prompted to enter a number between 1 and 10 (inclusive). The program randomly generates a number within the same range, and the user has to keep guessing until they get it right. The program provides feedback based on whether the user's guess is too low or too high.
Features:
•	Uses the random module to generate a random number.
•	Takes user input for their guess.
•	Provides feedback for incorrect guesses ("Too low" or "Too high").
•	Congratulates the user upon a successful guess.
How to Use:
1.	Save the code as a Python file (e.g., number_guessing_game.py).
2.	Run the script from your terminal using python number_guessing_game.py.
3.	Follow the prompts to enter your guesses.
Learning Objectives:
•	This project is a great introduction to Python programming concepts like:
o	Importing modules (random)
o	Working with random numbers
o	Taking user input (input)
o	Using conditional statements (if, elif, else)
o	Loops (while)
o	Basic game development principles
